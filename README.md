# javascript_the_weird_parts
Javascript is the language that modern developers need to know, and know well. 
Truly knowing Javascript will get you a job, and enable you to build quality web and server applications.  

NOTE: This course includes information on ECMAScript 6 (ES6) the next version of Javascript!  

In this course you will gain a deep understanding of Javascript, learn how Javascript works under the hood, and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and drastically improve your ability to debug problems. 
You will find clarity in the parts that others, even experienced coders, may find weird, odd, and at times incomprehensible. 
You'll learn the beauty and deceptive power of this language that is at the forefront of modern software development today.  
This course will cover such advanced concepts as objects and object literals, function expressions, prototypical inheritance, functional programming, scope chains, function constructors (plus new ES6 features), immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs), call, apply, bind, and more.  
We'll take a deep dive into the source code of popular frameworks such as jQuery and Underscore to see how you can use your understanding of Javascript to learn (and borrow) from other's good code.  
Finally, you'll learn the foundations of how to build your own Javascript framework or library. 
What you'll learn in this course will make you a better Javascript developer, and improve your abilities in AngularJS, NodeJS, jQuery, React, Ember, MongoDB, and all other Javascript-based technologies!  
Learn to love Javascript, and code in it well.  Note: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. 
You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to.
